    <h1>Relation and Function

    <h2>What are Relations and Functions?</h2>
    <br>

    <p>
<b><em>Relations and functions</em></b> define a mapping between two sets (Inputs and Outputs) such that they have ordered pairs of the form (Input, Output). Relation and function are very important concepts in algebra. They are used widely in mathematics as well as in real life. Let us define each of these terms of relation and function to understand their meaning.</p>

    <h2>Relation and Function Definition
</h2><br>
<p><b>RELATIONS</b></p>
<p>
It is a subset of the Cartesian product. Or simply, a bunch of points (ordered pairs). In other words, the relation between the two sets is defined as the collection of the ordered pair, in which the ordered pair is formed by the object from each set.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FUNCTIONS</b></p>

<p>A function is a relation which describes that there should be only one output for each input (or) we can say that a special kind of relation (a set of ordered pairs), which follows a rule i.e., every X-value should be associated with only one y-value is called a function.</p>

  <h2>Domain and Range  </h2>
<p>Domain and Range are the components of a function. </p>
<p><b>DOMAIN</b></p>
<p>
	A domain refers to "all the values" that go into a function. The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs for the function. Consider this box as a function f(x) = 2x . Inputting the values x = {1,2,3,4,...}, the domain is simply the set of natural numbers and the output values are called the range.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RANGE</b></p>
<p>	The range of a function is the set of all its outputs. Example: Let us consider the function f: A 	&rarr; B, where f(x) = 2x and A and B = {set of natural numbers}. Here we say A is the domain and B is the co-domain. Then the output of this function becomes the range. The range = {set of even natural numbers}. The elements of the domain are called pre-images and the elements of the co-domain which are mapped are called the images. Here, the range of the function f is the set of all images of the elements of the domain (or) the set of all the outputs of the function.</p>

<br>
<ul>
<li><em>One-to-One Function</em></li>
<p>Each 
<em>x</em>
-value corresponds to one distinct 
<em>y</em>
-value.</p>

<br>

<li><em>Many-to-One Function</em></li>

<p>Multiple 
<em>x</em>
-values correspond to the same 
<em>y</em>
-value.</p>


<br>

<li><em>One-to-Many Function</em></li>

<p>One 
<em>x</em>
-value corresponds to multiple 
<em>y</em>
-values.</p>

<br>
<li><em>Many-to-Many Function</em></li>

<p>Multiple 
<em>x</em>
-values correspond to multiple 
<em>y</em>
-values.</p>

   <br> <h2>Dependent and Independent Variables    </h2><br>

<p><b>INDEPENDENT VARIABLE</b></p>

<p>The independent variable is the factor the researcher changes or controls in an experiment. It is called independent because it does not depend on any other variable. The independent variable may be called the “controlled variable” because it is the one that is changed or controlled. This is different from the “control variable,” which is variable that is held constant so it won’t influence the outcome of the experiment.
</p><p>

<p><b>DEPENDENT VARIABLE</b></p>
<p>
The dependent variable is the factor that changes in response to the independent variable. It is the variable that you measure in an experiment. The dependent variable may be called the “responding variable.”
</p>
<br>
<p><b>EXAMPLES of INDEPENDENT  and DEPENDENT VARIABLE </b></p><br>

<br>
<p><b>Other examples:</b></p><br>

<ol>
<p>In a study to determine whether how long a student sleeps affects test scores, the independent variable is the length of time spent sleeping while the dependent variable is the test score.
</p>

<p>
You want to know which brand of fertilizer is best for your plants. The brand of fertilizer is the independent variable. The health of the plants (height, amount and size of flowers and fruit, color) is the dependent variable.</p>

<p>
You want to compare brands of paper towels, to see which holds the most liquid. The independent variable is the brand of paper towel. The dependent variable is the volume of liquid absorbed by the paper towel.
</p>

<br><h2>Graph and Linear Function   
    </h2>
<br>

<p>The graph of the linear equation is a set of points in the coordinate plane that all are solutions to the equation. If all variables represent real numbers one can graph the equation by plotting enough points to recognize a pattern and then connect the points to include all points.</p>
